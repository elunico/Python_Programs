Python_Programs
===============
I know more Python than I do anything else and I do not know a lot of Python. I'm a beginner. I do know how to make a dumb rock, paper, scissors game and a way to read in matrices from Quadratic equations and find their solution using Cramer's Method. That's what you'll find so far.
