Python_Programs
===============
So Basically, I think Python is a little crazy. 
I mean no offense, it does some *amazing* things for real
But overall it is very slow in execution (I mean look at 
C with optimization or Java even) probably because
it is really a scripting more than a programming
language. 

Still, I like python for simple things, 
for automation and of course for PyGames and Tkinter

I do lots of things with Python from making quadratic solvers
to text games, hangman, and many others.

Check back later and I hope to have some more

I'm so far the most knowledgeable about Python because 
I am very much a beginner but there will be more
languages to come (I hope)!
